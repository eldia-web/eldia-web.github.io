				<p style="text-align: justify">Hydrogeologists commonly inform decision makers by predicting the impacts of proposed activities on
future water resources. In many cases, one stakeholder hires them to perform analyses that are most
relevant to their decisions, leaving other stakeholders to make decisions based on a model that is less
well-suited—or even inappropriate—to account for the concerns that are central to their decision
context. One approach to address this disconnect and provide predictions relevant to all stakeholders is
to build an ensemble of models that span the range of plausible conditions. This ensures that all
stakeholders can make better-informed decisions; but it raises a difficult practical question. How can all
stakeholders come to consensus decisions based on multiple, possibly conflicting models? One path
forward may be through Good Neighbor Agreements (GNAs) which are legally binding agreements
developed between a business and another party to direct concerns and expectations regarding the
potential impacts of business’ operations on the local environment and community. With these
agreements, stakeholders can agree upon a course of action, possibly based on one model or a
combination of models, with caveats that account for the predictions of other models in the ensemble.
This allows all parties to make decisions based on the best available science with contingencies to
address uncertainties. My work will use artificial intelligence to conduct an initial analysis of the
structure of GNAs and then propose a GNA that supports water-resources negotiations that will achieve
more fair, equitable, and positive outcomes in Southern Arizona.</p>
