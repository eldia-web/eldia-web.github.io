				</header>
				<p style="text-align: justify"> PDF Format Rubrics are intended to give meaningful feedback to students on their talks/presentations and designs. Their use actively supports our ongoing assessment of student learning and program outcomes, a vital and important part of our academic mission. Forms for your review are provided below.  Hard copies of these forms, prepopulated with the student’s information, will be provided to you the day of the event.</p>

				<p style="text-align: justify"> The event starts at 8:00 am.  Click <a href="https://eldia-web.github.io/agenda.html"> here </a>for the day’s agenda.  Judges are asked to arrive at the event at 8:00am for an orientation of the judging process.  This orientation will take place in the ENR2 building Room S120B, and access to this meeting room is through the Slot Canyon Café located at the southeast corner of the building on the first floor.  Please notify Erma Santander at ermasan@arizona.edu if you are unable to be at the 8:00 orientation so we can schedule an individual orientation on your arrival.</p>

				<p style="text-align: justify"> In preparation for the day of judging, we have provided student abstracts for both the <a href="https://eldia-web.github.io/abstracts_oral.html"> Oral </a> and <a href="https://eldia-web.github.io/abstracts_poster.html"> Poster </a> Presentations on the El Día Website.  Please review these abstracts to familiarize yourself with the presentations before El Día, giving you more one-on-one with students to ask questions.</p>

				<p style="text-align: justify"> Once you have evaluated your assigned presentations and have provided your meaningful feedback on all sections of the rubrics, you will be asked to tally your scores on a final score sheet and return all evaluations back to room S120B to be collected for the award selection process.  Room S120B is dedicated to the judges as a quiet and private space to discuss and finalize evaluations. </p>

				<p style="text-align: justify"> <strong>Please note these 3 important rules:</strong> </p>


				<ul>
					<li>The rubric is a checklist of criteria at different levels of performance for specific categories.
					<ul>
						<li>Note: Students may hit criteria under a multitude of levels for one category, e.g. demonstrating criteria under both advanced and proficient levels for the category "Scientific Merit and Content of Presentation."</li>
					</ul></li>	
					<li>Students should not be awarded a score of Less Than 1 on the rubric unless they are severely under-prepared or unprepared.
					<ul>
					<li>You must assess a student’s performance based on where they are currently in their research.  Research that is ongoing and has not yet been completed is NOT a reason to give a score of a 1 (which means Approaching).  
					<ul>						
						<li>Students who are still in the process of completing their research have just as much potential to earn scores of 3 (Proficient) or 5 (Advanced) as students who have completed their research.  Please see the rubric criteria to determine what is necessary for each level.</li>
					</ul></li>	
					<li>You will assign the students a score for each category of the rubric.  After you have assessed each category, you will then add the scores up for each of the categories to determine the overall score.  That overall score will go in the associated spot on the last page of the rubric.</li>	
					</ul></p>
