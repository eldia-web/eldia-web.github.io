						<p style="text-align: center">Water Security in the Arid Southwest: Institutions, Science, and Solutions</p>
					</header>
					<p style="text-align: justify">Narrative:  For Arizona and the Arid Southwest, securing water for people and nature is a non-trivial challenge with ties to the interactions of climate, infrastructure, and history. That challenge has been amplified recently by Tier 1 shortage declarations from the Colorado River and COVID-19. Yet ‘water security’ means different things to the science, advocacy, and industry leaders who use the term. As panelist Janene Yazzie of Sixth World Solutions states: “Our challenges are so complex. Our histories are so complex, and our solutions need to mirror that… informed by the limitations and types of relationships that exist within our ecosystems.” What does securing water mean, how do ‘we’ go about it, and where do scientists fit in? Yazzie is joined by SandY Fabritz-Whitney of Freeport McMoRan to ask these questions in the keynote event for the University of Arizona Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Science’s annual conference, EL DÍA DEL AGUA Y LA ATMÓSFERA. Please Join - Attendance is free!</p>
